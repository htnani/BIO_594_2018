# Assignment due on 4/4/2018


In the directory, `/home/BIO594/Exercises/Week_7and8`, you will find a few useful files and two directories, `realdata` and `simulated`

I would like you to complete the following and push it to your own folder in this repository directory.

* For the simulated data
  * Call SNPs
  * Filter the SNPs
  * Run at least two outlier detection programs
    * Generate a VCF file with only neutral SNPs
  * Run at least one PCA and one DAPC with the neutral data
* For the realdata
  * Run BayeScan
  * Run BayEnv
  * Run at least one PCA and one DAPC using outlier free data set
  
  
Each directory has a `popmap` `environ` and `LibraryInfo` files

`popmap` is a mapping of individuals to populations

`environ` is an environmental factor file for BayEnv

`LibraryInfo` maps samples to sequencing library

There are also PGDspider configuration files and an R file for BayeScan output plotting.

### Have fun!

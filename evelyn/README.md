The two species of interest to be analysed for population structure are round sardine  and flat sardine.
These are two separate species which are among the most abundant small pelagic sardine fish species in the Gulf of Guinea region in West Africa however, currently, their abundance is known to fluctuate greatly and declining in the region. The population structure for each of these species among the countries (Mauritania, Ghana, TOgo, Benin, senegal) is currently absent . The technique used in studying the population structure of these species is Restricted Associated DNA sequences (RADSEQ) specifically ddRAD.
The bioinformatics pipeline used in proessing of the Raw sequence reads is dDocent pipeline and the all other analysis performed in R statistical packages.
